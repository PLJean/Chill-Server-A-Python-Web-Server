Chill Server
============
The coolest Python 3 webserver. Runs best with Python 3.4.

=======
Run: python3 setup.py

Run Server
==========
Run: python3 ChillServer <port_number>

It would be best to use a 5 digit number as many of the lower numbers are reserved for commonly used ports such as SSH, Email, and Web.
